# hello-world
Just another repository
Well, I'm a civil engineer who likes thecnology and is learning to code. I have the objective of improving my programming skills and use that at my job. Or, maybe, use AS my job, in case of I don't get one. At this time, I'm learning Python and MySQL.
I think I have a long journey before me :)
